# Slush Pool Importer for Specter Desktop

This is an add-on to Specter Desktop that leverages Specter's extensions mechanism to add external tools and 3rd party services.

The Slush Pool API does not enable access to any information regarding the address that mining rewards will be sent to. So unfortunately this extension can't offer the kind of tight integration that would be ideal.

Instead the best we can do is export the existing Slush Pool mining rewards and sync those deposits with addresses in our Specter Desktop wallets.

So until the Slush Pool API is expanded, this extension is just a glorified csv importer for the Slush Pool rewards data.
